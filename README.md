## INTRO

**Rio Crypto Hub** is an initiative whose principle is to strengthen the **web 3.0** scene in the city of Rio de Janeiro, 
through monthly IRL events and weekly content on our social networks. Rio has become the ideal setting for encouraging 
**innovative projects** and **networking**, so whether you are a blockchain **beginner** or **builder**, this is the best place to be.

## SOCIAL IMPACT 

Part of the Rio Crypto Hub budget is intended for public school students to attend the event and also do an monthly edition 
at the Favela. This empowers our community, fostering a solid network as an important social tool.
Boosting young people from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro is not only an objective of the program, but the main 
reason why it exists. Our greatest ally in social and technological integration today is the TTK Movement.
